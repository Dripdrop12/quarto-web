Shiny interactive documents are really just normal Shiny applications that are created using `quarto render`. In fact, you don't need Quarto at all to serve interactive documents, rather, you can just `shiny run` the application generated by `quarto render`:

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
quarto render example.qmd
shiny run example-app.py
```

For any given `.qmd`, the generated Shiny application will be written to the base document name with the `-app.py` suffix appended (e.g. `example-app.py`). Note that the static HTML content located at `example.html` and `example_files/` is also part of the Shiny application.

You can deploy Shiny interactive documents using a variety of cloud hosting services and on-premisies servers. The most important things to remember when deploying interactive documents are:

1)  Your application consists of both the static HTML and Python script generated by `quarto render`. For an application generated from `example.qmd`, all of the following files need to be present at deployment time:

    ``` bash
    example-app.py
    example.html
    example_files/
    ```

2)  In the above example, your application entry point would `example-app:app`. This entry point is typically provided on the command line for various deployment techniques, and for normal Shiny applications is typically `app:app`. So when you see the documentation provide and example like this:

    ``` bash
    rsconnect deploy shiny . --entrypoint app:app
    ```

    You should translate it to this (assuming your source document is `example.qmd`):

    ``` bash
    rsconnect deploy shiny . --entrypoint example-app:app
    ```
