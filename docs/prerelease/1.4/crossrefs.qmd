## Crossreferenceable elements take arbitrary content

Crossreferenceable elements now support any kind of content.
In previous versions, Quarto figures needed (for the most part) to be images; Quarto tables needed to be `Table` elements, and so on.
In v1.4, you can declare a Figure like this:

````
::: {#fig-1}

::: {.figure-content}
This is the figure content.
:::

This is a caption.

:::
````

Here, the identifier of the figure is still `fig-1`, but the content of the "Figure" is a fenced Div with any kind of content. The figure
itself is still referenced by `@fig-1`. The prefix `fig` identifies the type of crossreferenceable element. By default, Quarto v1.4 has support
for Figures (`fig-`), Tables (`tbl-`) and Listings (`lst-`).

## Custom crossreferenceable types

In addition, Quarto v1.4 supports custom crossreferenceable types. If your document has a large number of, say diagrams or videos, you might
want to refer to them directly as such. To use them, add the following to your document or project metadata:

```yaml
crossref-custom: 
  - kind: float # crossreferenceable elements with captions are `float`
    prefix: Diagram # used as the prefix for reference in output ("In Figure 1, ..")
    name: Diagram # used as the prefix for captions ("Figure 1: ..")
    ref_type: dia # used as the prefix for the reference identifier ("In @fig-1, ...")
    latex_env: diagram # used as the custom environment in latex output
    latex_list_of_name: lod # used as the abbreviation for the latex collation
```

### Example: supplemental figures and tables

Using custom crossreferenceable types, you can also define "Supplemental Figures", by creating a new prefix (eg, `sfig-`) and giving it the
same appearance as regular figures. Then, if you only use this prefix in the supplements, you will get a fresh crossref counter.

(TODO: flesh this out with an example, possibly in `quarto-dev/quarto-examples`)

## Changes in HTML output

Keep in mind the following changes in the HTML output of figures, etc:

- The DOM structure for HTML figures used to be such that the following CSS selector would work:
  
  ```
  div#fig-elephant > figure > figcaption.figure-caption
  ```
  
  In Quarto v1.4, this is now
  
  ```
  div#fig-elephant > figure.quarto-float.quarto-float-fig > figcaption.quarto-float-caption.quarto-float-fig
  ```

  Here's a minimal, full HTML output for a figure:

  ```html
  <div id="fig-1" class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center anchored">
    <figure class="quarto-float quarto-float-fig figure">
    <div aria-describedby="fig-1-caption-0ceaefa1-69ba-4598-a22c-09a6ac19f8ca">
      <img src="./img/content.jpg">
    </div>
    <figcaption id="fig-1-caption-0ceaefa1-69ba-4598-a22c-09a6ac19f8ca" class="figure quarto-float-caption quarto-float-fig">
    Figure&nbsp;1: This is a caption.
    </figcaption>
    </figure>
  </div>
  ```

  Concretely: 

  - All crossreferenceable elements use the `figure` HTML element with class `quarto-float`.
  - Different float types are differentiated by the CSS class `quarto-float-fig` (or `-tbl`, `-lst`, or the `ref_type` of custom crossref types) as well as the additional CSS class `figure`, `table`, etc. 
    If the element is a subfloat, this will be `quarto-subfloat-fig`.
  - Similarly, float captions use the `figcaption` element with class `quarto-float-caption` (or `quarto-subfloat-caption` if they're a subfloat), and are differentiated by the same additional CSS classes.
  
  This setup lets all "floats" be uniformly targeted by a single CSS rule, as well as allowing specific float types and their captions be targeted by a single additional CSS selector.

- Images by themselves used to have a surrounding paragraph; they no longer do.

- Floats include an extra div for ARIA referencing, so that captions are referenced appropriately and uniformly. 
  As a result, a table appears inside a float, its caption will be hoisted to the figure node itself
